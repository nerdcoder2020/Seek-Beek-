# 🐝 Seek-Beek- — The *Most Revolutionary QR System Ever Created*  
*(Or just another project because we were too stubborn to use an existing solution.)*  

## 🎯 What is Seek-Beek-?  
Welcome to **Seek-Beek-**, the QR code generator **so advanced, so sophisticated, and so unnecessary** that we’re surprised you’re even reading this.  

Need to generate QR codes? **Congratulations, you’ve joined the elite club of people who refuse to use Google’s free QR code generator.** 🎉  

## 🤯 Why Choose Seek-Beek-? (aka "Why We Built Another QR System")  
✅ **Generates QR Codes** – Just like every other QR generator, but this one is *ours*.  
✅ **Blazing Fast** – At least when it’s not crashing.  
✅ **Totally Secure** – Because nothing says security like trusting random GitHub code.  
✅ **Error Handling** – (*Translation:* It won’t just fail, it will *tell you* why it failed.)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (Because Every Project Needs Fancy Buzzwords)  
🚀 **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB *(Because using Firebase would’ve been too easy.)*  
🎨 **Frontend:** React.js *(Because everything is a React app these days.)*  
☁ **Hosting:** Somewhere in the void of the internet  

## 🔥 Fun Fact  
We could’ve just **used an API** to generate QR codes, but then what would we have spent hours debugging?
